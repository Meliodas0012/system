            <p class="context">
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With students' growing interest in pursuing their education at the institution of
                their choice, although they are distant from where they live. We're developing an Online Enrollment
                System(OEMS) to bridge this gap. This state of heart system was designed to simplify the enrollment
                process for students, providing a quicker and more user friendly experience. A simple interface, real
                time notifications and integration with current student information systems are some of the main
                features.

            <p class="sop1">
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The purpose of this study is to address the issues of aspiring Asian College
                student who live far away from ACSAT. This study aims to identify the common problems and challenges
                students encounter when enrolling. The research question that will guide this study are: <br> <br> 1.
                What is online enrollment management system? <br> <br> 2. What are the challenges of an aspiring Asian
                College students face when enrolling? <br> <br> 3. How can online management system help ease the
                challenges of an aspiring Asian College students? <br> <br> 4. What are the benefits of online
                enrollment management system towards Asian College Students? <br> <br> 5. How does online enrollment
                management system manage the satisfaction of aspiring Asian College students?

                Null Hypothesis: <br> <br> 1. There is no significant difference in enrollment rates before and after
                the implementation of an Online Enrollment Management System in Asian colleges. <br> <br> Alternative
                Hypotheses: <br> <br> 1. The implementation of an Online Enrollment Management System in Asian colleges
                will lead to a significant increase in enrollment rates compared to the period before its
                implementation. <br> <br> 2. Asian colleges implementing a streamlined Online Enrollment Management
                System will observe a decrease in dropout rates among enrolled students compared to colleges with less
                efficient enrollment systems.

            </h3>

            <p class="sop1">
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The significance of this study on online enrollment management systems lies in
                exploring the experiences and challenges users face during the registration process. Using a
                non-probability approach, this study aims to uncover valuable insights into the realities of navigating
                an online registration system. This information will help adjust system functionality and user interface
                to improve user experience and streamline the enrollment process. Educators and administrators can use
                the results to develop more effective training programs and support systems for students and staff
                participating in the use of online registration systems. Additionally, by highlighting the complexities
                of online enrollment, the study helps improve accessibility and efficiency, thereby ensuring a smoother
                registration experience for all parties involved. The results of the study will merit the following:
                <br>
                <br> <b>Students .</b> The study would offer the participants a platform which is online enrollment
                systems to give students with the comfort of enrolling for courses from anywhere with internet access.
                This flexibility can be particularly beneficial for students with busy schedules or those who live
                off-campus. <br>

        <div>

            <p class="sop1">
                <br> <b>Teachers.</b> The online enrollment system gives teachers real-time access to enrolment data,
                allowing them to assess student interest in a particular course and plan lessons accordingly. This helps
                us optimize course delivery and ensure class sizes and facilities are appropriate.
                <br> <br> <b>Parents. </b>The online enrollment system allows parents to complete the registration
                process for their child from the comfort of their home, eliminating the need to visit the school in
                person. This convenience is especially beneficial for busy parents who have conflicting work schedules
                or need to enroll multiple children. Online enrollment systems also includes communication features that
                allow parents to easily communicate with school administrators, teachers, and counselors about
                registration-related questions and concerns.

                <br> <br> <b> Future researchers.</b> The results of the study can serve as an empirical evidence to
                support or refute hypotheses regarding the implementation and impact of online registration systems.
                Future researchers can build on this evidence base by conducting additional studies to validate the
                results, examining additional variables, and question different situations.

                are unable to physically visit Asian College for enrollment purposes. It also serves as a platform that
                gives students access to news and updates about Asian College in real time, allowing them to stay
                informed about recent changes made to the institution. This is a quantitative system that makes use of
                sign-up forms for the students to enroll in Asian College. Students from various locations who wish to
                enroll in Asian College are the target demographic, and the time frame falls within Asian College's
                enrollment period.
